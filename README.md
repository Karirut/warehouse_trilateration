# warehouse_trilateration
## Smart Logistics and Perceptive Localization (SLPL)
* Through Smart Logistics and Perceptive Location (SLPL), the goal was to locate packages using Bluetooth and RFID
tags within a warehouse, in addition to using a cloud-based database.
* Through the usage of different tools, my team and I created a 3D map using ROS2 PointCloud and a web page using
NodeJS to display the packagesâ€™ movement in real time and the database.

Here you will find the codes used for trilateration (and scalable for multilateration) using the bluetooth module inside the Raspberry Pi 5.
Here's also the web page created using NodeJS to display the 3D map of the warehouse, a 2D map generated using RVIZ (ROS2) and the package's information from the database.
