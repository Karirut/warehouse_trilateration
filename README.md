# warehouse_trilateration
Here you will find the codes used for trilateration (and scalable for multilateration) using the bluetooth module inside the Raspberry Pi 5.
Here's also the web page created using NodeJS to display the 3D map of the warehouse, a 2D map generated using RVIZ (ROS2) and the package's information from the database.
